This is a 3D printable circuit splitter for ventilators to be used in last case, disaster, emergency scenarios when the number of patients needing emergent intubation and ventilation exceeds the available number of ventilators. Using a method previously described by Dr. Neyman & Dr. Irvin in 2006, a single ventilator can be used to provide ventilation to 2, 3, or 4 patients. Although commercial T-splitters can be repurposed for this, not every institution have the parts available. Additionally, in disaster scenarios such parts may be exhausted, or no longer be available due to supply-chain failures as with the COVID-19 pandemic. This theory was put into practice in the 2017 Las Vegas shooting by EM physician Dr. Kevin Menes.  

We have tested and appears to hold pressure and fit well on the following ventilators: GE Advance, Draeger Apollo, Draeger Evita. However the fittings are a universal size and should fit on all ventilators regardless of manufacturer. The Y-splitter has been sized to accomodate the majority of inline filters without the need of added extensions. 

***Please keep in mind this should be a last resort tool, when all other options are exhausted and the loss of life is imminent.***

# Usage
To accomplish two patient ventilation, you need two Y-splitters. One goes onto the inspiratory limb, and the other goes on the expiratory limb. To accomplish 4 patient ventilation, you need a total of six Y-splitters. A splitter is fitted with a splitter on each of its forks. 

Included are flow limiters that are to be used if you need to reduce the volume/flow to a particular patient. This may be needed if you have a large discrepancy in the characteristics of patients sharing a vent. The 18mm limiter has a larger opening than the 10mm limiter. Thus, the 10mm limiter will limit the flow more than the 18mm limiter. 

# Limitations
Since multiple patients will be using the same ventilator settings, the vent mode must be controlled. Since coughing, bucking, or spontaneous breathing will be transmitted to the other patients, all patients must be relaxed.  

There is a possibility of cross-contamination between patients, and thus inline filters should be used to protect the patients and the ventilator. The same filters will also protect from stray filament pieces from being transmitted from the manufacturing process. 

# Printing
The splitter is intended to be printed in an "upside-down-Y" configuration if using FDM printing. This way, no supports are needed. We recommend a small brim to promote bed adhesion. We recommend 100% infill to minmize possibility of leaks or breakage.
